Exploring Netflix Viewing Trends with Tableau
This Tableau visualization project provides interactive dashboards to uncover insights from Netflix's catalog and viewing data. 
The dashboards contained in this repository allow readers to analyze Netflix's content library growth over time as well as compare viewership statistics across genres, ratings, release years, and more.

This report aims to answer key questions such as:

How has Netflix's content library changed over the years?
Which types of Netflix movies and shows are most popular among viewers?
How do viewership numbers compare across different genres and MPAA ratings?
Which categories have seen the most growth in viewership in recent years?
The visualizations are powered by a dataset of over 8,000 Netflix movies and shows as well as daily global viewing figures for those titles across an eight-year period. Advanced Tableau functionality is leveraged in these dashboards to enable intuitive interactive filtering, sorting, and drilling down across multiple dimensions.

The insights from this analysis can help identify trends in Netflix usage and guide decisions on content acquisition, production, and marketing. The Tableau dashboards provide a powerful analytical perspective for understanding the platform's viewers and interests.
